  <h1>Week Two Journal Entry</h1>
  <p>Things that went well this week:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Objects and arrays; creating and accessing information within
    </li>
    <li>Basic loops; for, while, do...while,</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Things that did not go well this week:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Functions; getting started what to put in them, what all I need, where to get it all</li>
    <li>DOM, when and where to tag things in JS with ID's</li>
    <li>Draw function</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Week Three Journal Entry</h1>
  <p>Things that went well this week:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This week mainly focused on MVC and encapsulation which was not a strong week for me and i'll just leave it at
      that.
    </li>
    <li>I get how the service window encompasses all the logic and data and that the controller is the window that
      requests that information from the service; and that this only happens when the user requests that info from the
      view page it requests from controller who accesses the information from the service window to keep select data
      from being used in unintentional ways.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Things that did not go well this week:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I struggle through the MVC in trying to get the right information to access each other. I dont know if I just
      need more practice or what but I can never seem to figure out what is supposed to go into each export defualt
      class; mainly because they are all similar functions/methods. And I know i'm missing a lot of stuff but I never
      know what it is where its missing from.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Week Four Journal Entry</h1>
  <p>Things that went well this week:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Getting a better understanding/feel for the overall flow of the weeks.
    </li>
    <li>Understanding how the MVC-Observer communicates with each other and accessing the Api servers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Things that did not go well this week:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Struggling when we start to work with multiple Api's and also having trouble getting my data to render to the
      screen. Like we talked about in the meeting, also struggling with the debugging and console.logging in the right
      spots to figure out what data im pulling/where my errors are.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Things I'm looking forward to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I'm looking forward to working with servers and our own Api's. Building our own api's and of course continuing
      to work with JavaScript.</li>
  </ul>
